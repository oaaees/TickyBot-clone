#	TickyBot Website Clone

##	Overview

I started this project to fulfill one of the requirements to apply to [Chingu.io](https://chingu.io/), a place to gain experience as a web developer. Through this project I can certify the knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript needed to start in this voyage!

##	Features

This is a simple clone of this [TickyBot webpage](http://tickybott.herokuapp.com/), it was my goal to recreate it writing my own code in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript

I'm planning to also complete the extra (not required) steps that were recomended in the [Chingu Guidelines](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-tickybot-clone)

- [ ] Make the design fully responsive 
- [ ] Anticipate and handle any edge cases
- [ ] Use Accessibility techniques to improve the site for users with impairments

##	Running The Project

You can download the files and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser, or alternatively you can visit [oaaees.github.io/Tickybot-clone](oaaees.github.io/Tickybot-clone) where it is hosted by Github Pages.
